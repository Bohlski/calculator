- Fix floating point rounding
- Make bound on digits allowed for no 'screen overflow'
- Make decimal button work
- Make plus/minus button work
- Make formula below main screen update as buttons are clicked
- Let equals button be pressed repeatedly, such that the same operation is repeated as on real calculator (right now a bit backwards)
- Maybe show a small sign to the side, to see the currently active operator
